                            The Dane County Humane Society Mobile Application is modeled after the non-profit organization - Dane County Humane Society. This mobile application was designed for efficiency, and has two different sides to it: (1) DCHS employees (2) Customers. The DCHS Mobile Application serves to provide all services the website already provides, in addition to introducing an array of new functionalities such as a Calendar, a Notifications tab, etc.

                            This Portfolio Website is my first project for Summer 2020. The purpose of this application is to act as a platform to showcase my technical skills and creativity! I love learning and experimenting with new languages and technology, and this web app allowed me to play with React, React-MDL, React Router, CSS and Javascript. Designing this application was incredibly fun and Iâ€™ll definitely come back to improve the nitty gritty of this project!
